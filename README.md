Griotte
=======

Griotte is a framework that turns a Raspberry Pi into a programmable multimedia
player.

Associated with a [RaspiOMix](https://github.com/hugokernel/RaspiOMix) interface
and sensors (temperature, distance, RFID, ..., you name it), the player can
react to external events, activate external devices, drive lights via DMX, ...

While RaspiOMix uses [SeeedStudio's Grove
system](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/GROVE_System), giving access to a wide
range of sensors and actuators, any 3.3v/5v sensor can be used.

Griotte can play scenarios written with
[Blockly](https://code.google.com/p/blockly/) simply by dragging and dropping
blocks.

Applications include museum players (that can react to visitors for instance),
educational tools (learning about programming or sensors), home automation,
lighting systems, ...
